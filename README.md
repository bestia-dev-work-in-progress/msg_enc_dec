## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

The implementation contained in this crate has never been independently audited!  
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Try it

For encrypted communication between two parties, both must use msg_enc_dec.  
Install msg_enc_dec from GitHub.  
It is preferred to use Rust locally to build the program, so you know exactly the source code.  
You can also download the executable binaries from this repository Github Releases, but there you have no way to know exactly what source code has been used.  
On Linux (I use Debian inside WSL on Windows):  

```bash
cd ~/rustprojects
git clone git@github.com:bestia-dev-ready-for-use/msg_enc_dec.git
code msg_enc_dec
cargo auto release
alias msg_enc_dec="./target/release/msg_enc_dec"
msg_enc_dec --help
```

## Windows git-bash

TODO: Let's try install rust in Windows git-bash and build msg_enc_dec there.
Git-bash is installed when I install git for Windows from <https://git-scm.com/downloads/win>.  
Download and run rustup-ini.exe from <https://rustup.rs>.  
Rust requires a linker and Windows API libraries but they don't seem to be available.
Choose:  
3) Don't install the prerequisites  
   (if you're targeting the GNU ABI).  

1) Proceed with standard installation (default - just press enter)
 This is dependent on Microsoft Visual Studio. We don't want that.

2) Customize installation
  
      
In git bash run

```bash

```
